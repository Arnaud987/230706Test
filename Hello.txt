Hello, 
My Name is Arnaud Saulais, 

I have just subscribed again, at the EPFL DSML program. 
I initially registered in 2021, I but failed to properly study and I had to cancel my registration after just a few months, due to heavy workload and a new member into my family (a little girl ;)). 

Over the past two years, I studied python and VBA coding. Following courses on datacamp website and with a private professor.
Now I have more time to dedicate to the EPFL Machine learning program, and I am very motivated to complete the course this time. I received very good feedbacks from friends who followed the course either. 

To introduce myself, I like statistics and commodity markets (I am working within the commodity trading industry) and, I am eager to develop more tools to analyze and predict commodity markets. 

I am looking forward to meet you during our next 1 to 1.

Best Regards

Arnaud
